  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve tested many lab‑grade injection waters over the years, but Swisschems Bacteriostatic Water 10 ml really stood out. As someone who regularly reconstitutes peptide powders and hormone powders, I need a sterile solution that’s clear, reliable, and easy to use. In this review, I’ll share my personal experience, testing methods, pros and cons, and answer common questions—all to help you decide if this is the right water for your protocols.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Bacteriostatic Water?</h2>
  <p>
    Bacteriostatic water is sterile water for injection that contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative. This prevents microbial growth, letting you withdraw multiple doses from the same vial for up to 28 days once opened. It’s essential for reconstituting lyophilized peptides (like growth hormone or ipamorelin) and many hormone therapies.

  <h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems Bacteriostatic Water</h2>
  <p>
    To rank Swisschems against two other brands (a generic sterile water and another peptide‑grade water), I used the following criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity under light:</strong> No visible particles or cloudiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Sterility confidence:</strong> Safe multi‑use up to 28 days.</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of syringe draw:</strong> Smooth plunger action, precise dosing.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging quality:</strong> Vial seal integrity and clear labeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Value for money:</strong> Price per ml vs. performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In my tests, Swisschems scored highest on clarity (no particles under bright LED lamp), sterility (trusted bottle seal), and ease of use (plunger glides smoothly). It also came in a compact 10 ml amber vial that fits in any storage rack. Overall rating: <strong>9.5/10</strong>.
